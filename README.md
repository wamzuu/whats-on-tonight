# [WIP] What's on Tonight?

## Overview

**What's on Tonight?** is a web app that helps users keep track of serialized media (TV shows, anime, comics, manga, manhwa) and displays which media releases on a given day. The app stores data locally and provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your watchlist.

## Features

- **Add Media Entries**: Users can add new media by selecting a name, release day, and media type.
- **What's on Tonight?**: Displays a list of media airing on the current day.
- **Edit & Delete Entries**: Users can modify or remove their media entries.
- **Smooth UI & Animations**: Popups and transitions for a polished user experience.
- **Persistent Data**: Saves media locally using `localStorage`.
- **Clear All Data**: A button to reset all stored media.

## Usage

1. Click **Add Media** to open the media entry form.
2. Enter a name, select a release day, and choose a media type.
3. Click **Submit**, and the media will be added to the database.
4. The **What's on Tonight?** section automatically updates based on the current day.
5. Use **Manage Media** to view, edit, or delete saved entries.
6. Click **Clear Data** to remove all stored media (this cannot be undone).

## Future Enhancements

- **User Accounts**: Store data in a database for cross-device syncing.
- **Search & Filters**: Allow users to find media easily.
- **Import/Export Data**: Enable users to back up their watchlist.
- **Custom Categories**: Let users define their own media types.
